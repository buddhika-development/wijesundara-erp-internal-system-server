The platform is architected around three core components to ensure scalability, security, and modular maintainability:

- **Customer and Supplier Portal**: Manages interactions with external suppliers and customers, allowing suppliers to place bids and submit stock availability directly.
- **Internal System Client**: Manages all internal operational interfaces used by staff and administrators.
- **Backend Server**: Handles all backend processing, data management, and API services.

By separating frontend and backend components, the system enhances security, optimizes performance, and allows each module to evolve independently.

### Custom Business Solutions

In addition to standard ERP modules, several custom solutions were engineered to address Wijesundara Rice Mill's unique operational challenges:

#### âž” Stock Transportation Tracking
Enables real-time tracking of stock movements during transportation, identifying responsible personnel, locations, and vehicles. This mitigates stock loss incidents by providing full traceability across the transportation chain.

#### âž” Transportation Task Assignment
Facilitates dynamic allocation of transportation requests to either company-owned or third-party vehicles. Departments can submit transportation requests, which are automatically processed and assigned based on vehicle availability and operational capacity.

#### âž” Stock State Management
Tracks inventory across multiple processing states (e.g., raw, semi-processed, final product), providing detailed insight into current stock levels and enabling more accurate production planning and sales forecasting.

#### âž” Supplier Bidding System
Automates the supplier bidding process by allowing suppliers to submit bids directly through the supplier portal. This simplifies procurement operations, increases transparency, and accelerates supplier negotiations.
